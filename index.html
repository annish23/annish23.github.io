	<p>Annish the Purple Rain (left) – Bass, Vocal<br>
	In the shadows of broken dreams and neon-lit rainstorms, Annish the Purple Rain emerged—not born, but summoned by the collective tears of the misunderstood. Forged from heartbreak, eyeliner, and late-night poetry no one will ever read, Annish channels pain into power and sadness into symphonies.
	As the haunting voice and thunderous bass behind every track, she doesn’t just set the tone—she is the tone. With fingers that dance across bass strings like ghosts tracing old scars, and a voice that sounds like a love letter from the void, Annish leads the charge through emotional wreckage with unapologetic melancholy.
	Purple isn’t just a color—it’s a lifestyle, a bruise on the soul, a forever storm that never quite ends.
	She doesn't just play music—she feels it so hard, the universe shivers. Influenced by midnight walks, cursed journals, and the scent of vintage despair, Annish is not here to entertain—she’s here to haunt you (musically, emotionally, and maybe spiritually).
	So if you’ve ever stared out the window at 3am wondering if anyone really understands… Annish the Purple Rain was born from that feeling.
